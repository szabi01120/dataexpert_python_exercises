Well, that's a first
I usually get a notification when that happens
Why do you want to do it that way?
I'm not familiar with it so I didn't fix it in case I made it worse
It's never done that before
That wasn't in the original specification
It probably won't happen again
That isn't covered by my job description
I can have a look but there's a lot of if statements in that code!
Somebody must have changed my code
The third party documentation is wrong
Oh, that was only supposed to be a placeholder
You must be missing some of the dependencies
I thought you signed off on that?
That's not a bug it's a configuration issue
That error means it was successful
I'm still working on that as we speak
We outsourced that months ago
That's already fixed it just hasn't taken effect yet
The download must have been corrupted
The third party API is not responding
I thought I finished that
The project manager told me to do it that way
Our redundant systems must have failed as well
It's an unexpected emergent behaviour of several last minute abstractions
That feature would be outside of the scope
That important email must have been marked as spam
In the interest of efficiency I only check my email for that on a Friday
Your browser must be caching the old content
That wouldn't be economically feasible
That feature was slated for phase two
It's a browser compatibility issue
I can't test everything
It must be a firewall issue
Our code quality is no worse than anyone else in the industry
That process requires human oversight that nobody was providing
I can't make that a priority right now
Even though it doesn't work, how does it feel?
I must not have understood what you were asking for
That worked perfectly when I developed it
Maybe somebody forgot to pay our hosting company
That behaviour is in the original specification
I heard there was a solar flare today
I haven't had the chance to run that code yet
This is a previously known bug you told me not to work on yet
It must be a hardware problem
THIS can't be the source of THAT
It would take too long to rewrite the code from scratch
It must be because of a leap year
The problem seems to be with our legacy software
The marketing department made us put that there
Actually, that's a feature
Our internet connection must not be working
It must be because of a leap second
I had to do the project backwards as people demanded results out of order
That's interesting, how did you manage to make it do that?
What did I tell you about using parts of the system you don't understand?
I haven't been able to reproduce that
The client wanted it changed at the last minute
I was just fixing that
Management insisted we wouldn't need to waste our time writing unit tests
The WYSIWYG must have produced an invalid output
I have never seen that before in my life
I'm surprised it works as well as it does
This code was not supposed to go in to production yet
I was told to stop working on that when something important came up
What did you type in wrong to get it to crash?
I couldn't find any examples of how that can be done anywhere else in the project
It would have taken twice as long to build it properly
Well at least we know not to try that again
